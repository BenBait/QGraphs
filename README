Code for Ben Maloy's 2023 Master's Thesis

The point of this code is to numerically determine if the probability of
finding an entry in a graph structured database is affected by tweaking
the transition probability between entries.

The database is a graph where each edge in a complete graph has 2 nodes
inserted into every edge.

The following landmarks in the thesis have been coded up

 - Finding the Probabilistic Graph Laplacian, L
 - Confirming that L is self-adjoint under the M-adjoint operator
 - Calculating the success probability where the exponential is given by a Taylor series

Run ./build.sh 1 to build executable to check that L is self-adjoing 
Run ./build.sh 2 to build executable to calculate the success probability
