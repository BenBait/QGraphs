\section{Numerical Calculations of the Success Probability}
So far, programs have been written to the following ends:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculating the Probabilistic Graph Laplacian, $\Delta$
\item Confirming that $\Delta$ is self-adjoint under the $M$-adjoint operator
\item Calculating the success probability where the exponential is given by a Taylor series
\end{enumerate}
