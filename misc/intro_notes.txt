H = T + V

T -> kinetic energy corresponds to a Laplacian; we want to apply this Laplacian to a graph

V -> Potential energy (problem specific); i.e.) for Grover's algorithm

Given this potential, how do we scale the Laplacian with a parameter gamma

H = T(gamma) + V

Vary gamma to find optimal Hamiltonian

Complete graph: every node conects to another node
If the graph is complete, there is a unique gamma for which optimal Hamiltionian is found
for the Grover search algorithm

Laplacian gives you the probabilities that you go to another vertex

   n1
n2     n3

prob(ni -> nj : i =/= j) = 1/2

So graph Laplacian is    1    -1/2   -1/2
                        -1/2  1      -1/2
						-1/2  -1/2    1

Note that this is the scaled version of the Degree Matrix - Adjacency Matrix

The diagonals don't have probablistic interpretations; it makes it so that the sum of each
row is zero -> hence, we have a stochastic matrix (which makes it easy to find that the
ground state is zero)

(1 1 1 1)^T is an eigenstate (with 0 eigenvalue, which means it is harmonic)
Laplacian*v = 0 ==> v is harmonic

How is this related to kinetic energy?
Consider the discretization techniques for numerical differentiation
Now we make a Lattice instead of a Triangle

TASK: Code that generates the graph Laplacian on G_{3,p} which depend on the parameter p
